## Covid Application

### Architectural Decisions
We used <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> to develop this application - as it is easy to scale and has extended support. We used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/novelcovid">NovelCovid</a> as a wrapper for COVID-19 related data from the <a href="https://disease.sh/">Open Disease API</a> - this is because it has no request limits that exist on other options such as Rapid API. We also used <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> as a web framework as it is minimalist and unopinionated. Alongside this, we used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars">Express Handlebars</a> as a Handlebars view engine for Express as it is simple as easy to use.
